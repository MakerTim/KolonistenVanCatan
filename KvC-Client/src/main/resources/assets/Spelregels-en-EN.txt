Rules

Original author: Klaus Tauber
2 to 6 players aged 11 years


Goal
The player who will score the first 10 or more points wins the game. The number of points may varies
between 10 and 15, depending on what you agree in advance.


Structure of the board
Divide the land and sea spaces. Leave a land tile in the middle, followed by two desert fields there
parallel to. Continue with the rest of the land tiles in a spiral shape around the middle, so that the
country is a symmetry. And finally place the sea tile around the island. You do this alternately in
the order Water - 2: 1 harbor - Water - 3: 1 harbor. The rotation of the harbor is random, but both
harbor points must connect with the mainland.


Then the number tokens are placed on the game board with the letters up and this in
a spiral shape, starting from a tile corner of choice. If all the tokens are placed on the board,
they are turned over so that the numbers are clearly visible.


The numbers (2 to 12) are each twice in the game (except the 2 and 12 itself:
only 1 time). They give the probability of the sum of the two dice.
The larger the size of the number, the higher the probability that this sum is diced.
The highest occurring combinations (6 and 8) are also very clear printed in red.
No tokens are placed on the desert tiles.
Once the board is structured, each player chooses a color and will recieve 5
villages (houses), 4 cities (churches), 15 blocks (streets) and ancard of the building costs.
The resource cards are placed in five open stacks next to the board. The
variants are forest (wood), pasture (wool), field (grain), Hill (stones), mountain (ore).
The development cards (darker back) are placed face down in a pile. The bandit (black pawn) needs to
be placed in the desert. The two special cards and dice be ready next to the board.


Settlement Phase
This phase is spread over two rounds. Each player is given the opportunity to two
build villages and two lanes before starting the game itself.

First round
Who dices the highest begins. He places one village on a corner of choice and connects
this to a street in a direction of choice. Subsequently, the other players are in the direction
clockwise turn. However, there should be kept in mind that there is a distance rule!
	- Distance rule
	  A settlement may only be put on a free intersection if the three
	  nearest intersections are free of buildings or settlements. It does not matter who
	  stands there, the intersection should be remain unoccupied.

Second round
After this, the person who was last in the first round, must place a second settlements. The
other players will follow in counterclockwise direction. The second settlements may be 
- taking into account the distance rule - placed everywhere. Immediately after placing the
second settlements, each player will recieve their first resources. For each land tile that is
adjacent to a settlement, the player will receive one corresponding resource card from the
stock. This resource cards keep Players hidden from each other. The last player placed his second settlement,
the game begins.

Gameplay
Each player goes through per turn the following three phases:
- Proceeds from the country
- act
- build
- Some special events


a) Proceeds from the land
The player in turn must roll both dice. The sum of the two dice determines
the prefix yielding commodities. Any player who has a settlement or city on this
diced piece of land, receives a resource map (two if a city). Are at a certain
moment no resource cards stock, no player will receive the card in that turn.

b) Dealing
Then the player who drive the turn, trade with other players in order to him
get missing resource cards. We distinguish won domestic trade
and maritime trade.

- Domestic Trade
The player may trade with all players commodity cards. He shares example with what he needs
and what he is willing to give in exchange for it. It is important that there should only act
be with the player's turn, not themselves among the other players.

- maritime trade
Here the player can trade without the help of his fellow players at the table resource cards.
In the most simple exchange, the player 4 resource cards of one kind exchange to 1
commodity card of your choice. Owning a port is not necessary. A player
However, a settlement or a city founded by the sea, it can be much more interesting deals
do. With a simple port (with?) The player can always exchange three identical resource cards
for another 1 to choice. At a special port the player has only two identical cards
the pictured commodity exchange against one new choice.

c) Building
The player whose turn it is can also build to increase his points. In exchange for
combinations of material cards (see overview map) he could arbitrarily many streets,
build settlements or cities.

cost:
street: wood + stone
A new road to be built on private roads, settlements and cities. On
each road can be built, of course, only one way. Once a player a contiguous
street has five pieces from the street, he receives the special card "longest commercial street"
presenting him two extra points. A commercial street can be interrupted or another
player can build a long road. At that moment, is that special card to the player
the longest street. When two or more players have an equally long street, the card is
back to the stock.

settlement: wood + stone + corn + yarn
Taking into account the distance rule. The settlement must meet at least one private street boundaries.
Any settlement on the board also provides one point and can yield 1 resource card if
the dice determine this.

City: 2 x 3 x ore grain +
The player builds his settlement into a city. He changes the cottage for a church.
Each city is worth 2 points and came second resource cards.

Development card: corn + wool + ore
If a player wants to buy a development card, he takes off the top of the stack in
exchange for the three required resource cards. The resulting map (s) he likes best secret for
others. A properly purchased card should not be used right away. There are 14 knights,
6 Progress and 5 points in the game.

d) Special events + cards

- Rover
If a player 7 dice at the beginning of his turn, the player must be one of the two
robbers moved to any other country field. The players who have villages or towns
the country field where the robbers will be placed and have more than seven cards, half must
to surrender their cards. These players also do not receive raw materials until the robber again
has been moved. The installer of the rover can still steal a resource from a player whose
Tile state where the rover has been placed, if available. There exist several players,
he chooses from one victim. Robbing itself happens locked: you can not see what kind
card you steal. As long as a robber on a tile state receives no player commodities
of that tile.

- Development Card play
A player's turn, may at any time during his turn 1
play development card (except the card he bought any network).

- Knight
When a player plays this card, he must put the rover on another country field. He steals
Also one resource card of any player who has a settlement or city.
Knight played cards remain open for the player on the table. A player with 3-played
Knight cards receives the special card "largest army". This gives him extra 2 points.
This card goes back to the stock if someone else as much knight maps is to
play, or go to the player who at that time again, the greatest knight power in front of them
has.

- Progress
The person who plays such a card, the following command which is run directly on the map.
The card then disappear back under the pile.
- Road construction: the player may immediately two new streets (free) build
- Discovery: the player may immediately take 2 resource cards of your choice
- Monopoly: all players have all their resource cards of a certain
kind - to be determined by the player using the card - giving that player points
- Points
These cards provide additional points to be the best and only shown on the end of the game.
